	<p>Retirement:
How early should you start saving for retirement? As early as possible! The earlier you save, the more time your money has to grow until your retirement.

What is a 401k? 401k is a retirement savings plan sponsored by the employer where you put part of  your paycheck into the account and your employer will contribute the same amount you contribute (up to 3% of your salary only). The amount that you contribute towards your 401k will not be taxed before your savings and investment plans. In other words, you will have the ability to invest money from your paycheck without being taxed. However, when you withdraw the money, it’s the time where you will pay the taxes. 

What is an IRA? A type of savings account that is designed to help you save for retirement and offers many tax advantages. There are two different types of IRAs: Traditional and Roth IRAs. 

What is a Roth IRA? A special retirement account funded by post-tax income (you can’t deduct contributions on income taxes). You pay no tax on withdrawing contributions, 

What is a Traditional IRA? A type of retirement account that lets your earnings grow tax-deferred (income and capital gains tax can be paid at a later date). You pay taxes in investment gains only when making withdrawals in retirement.

What are the differences between Traditional and Roth IRA’s? You must be under 70.5 years of age to contribute to a traditional IRA. You will pay ordinary income tax on withdrawals of all traditional IRA earnings and on contributions originally deducted on your taxes. Meanwhile, Roth IRA contributions have no age limit, contributions cannot be deducted, and contributions will not be taxed upon withdrawal. If you have reached 59.5 years of age and met the 5-year holding period requirement, withdrawals of earnings will not be taxed.
